## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

Cypilot is a deterministic agent tool that embeds into AI coding assistants and CI pipelines to provide structured workflows, artifact validation, and design-to-code traceability. Cypilot maximizes determinism: everything that can be validated, checked, or enforced without an LLM is handled deterministically; the LLM is reserved only for tasks that require reasoning, creativity, or natural language understanding.

The system is a single-layer generic engine:

- **Core** — deterministic command engine, generic workflows (generate/analyze), multi-agent integrations, global CLI, project configuration management, extensible kit system with GitHub-based kit installation, ID/traceability infrastructure, and Cypilot DSL (CDSL) for behavioral specifications

Domain-specific value is delivered by independently installable kits. The recommended SDLC kit (`cyberfabric/cyber-pilot-kit-sdlc`) provides an artifact-first development pipeline (PRD → DESIGN → ADR → DECOMPOSITION → FEATURE → CODE) with templates, checklists, examples, deterministic validation, cross-artifact consistency checks, and GitHub PR review/status workflows. Kits are external packages — Cypilot core contains no domain-specific content.

### 1.2 Background / Problem Statement

**Target Users**:
- Developers using AI coding assistants (Windsurf, Cursor, Claude, Copilot) for daily work
- Technical Leads setting up development methodology and project conventions
- Teams adopting structured design-to-code workflows with AI assistance
- DevOps engineers integrating Cypilot validation into CI/CD pipelines for artifact and code quality gates

**Key Problems Solved**:
- **AI Agent Non-Determinism**: AI agents produce inconsistent results without structured guardrails; deterministic validation catches structural and traceability issues that LLMs miss or hallucinate
- **Design-Code Disconnect**: Code diverges from design when there is no single source of truth and no automated traceability enforcement
- **Fragmented Tool Setup**: Each AI agent (Windsurf, Cursor, Claude, Copilot) requires different file formats for skills, workflows, and rules; maintaining these manually is error-prone
- **Inconsistent PR Reviews**: Code reviews vary in depth and focus without structured checklists and prompts; reviewers miss patterns that deterministic analysis catches
- **Manual Configuration Overhead**: Project-specific conventions, artifact locations, and validation rules require manual setup and synchronization across tools

### 1.3 Goals (Business Outcomes)

**Success Criteria**:
- A new user can install Cypilot globally and initialize a project in ≤ 5 minutes. (Baseline: not measured; Target: v2.0)
- Deterministic validation of any single artifact completes in ≤ 3 seconds on a typical developer laptop. (Baseline: ~1s current; Target: v2.0)
- 100% of `cpt-*` IDs defined in artifacts are resolvable via deterministic search without ambiguity. (Baseline: 100% current; Target: v2.0)
- Agent integration files for all supported agents are generated in ≤ 10 seconds. (Baseline: ~5s current; Target: v2.0)
- PR review workflow produces a structured review report within 2 minutes of invocation. (Baseline: not measured; Target: v2.0)

**Capabilities**:
- Install once globally, initialize per project with interactive setup
- Execute deterministic validation and traceability scanning without LLM
- Provide structured workflows for artifact creation, analysis, and code generation
- Generate and maintain agent-specific entry points for all supported AI assistants
- Review and assess GitHub PRs with configurable prompts and checklists
- Manage project configuration through a structured config directory edited only by the tool

## 5. Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Core

#### Global CLI Installer

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-installer`

The system MUST provide a global CLI tool installable with a single command. The tool MUST be available as both `cypilot` and the short alias `cpt`. The tool MUST:

1. Work both inside and outside projects.
2. Work offline after initial setup.
3. Perform non-blocking version checks — never delay command execution. Propose updates when a newer version is available.

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

#### Project Initialization

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-init`

The system MUST provide an interactive project initialization command that bootstraps Cypilot in a project. The command MUST:

1. Check for existing installation and refuse to overwrite — propose updating instead.
2. Ask for: installation directory, which agents to support (default: all), and per-kit config output directory.
3. Enable all available kits by default.
4. Set up the project directory structure.
5. Define a **root system** — deriving the project name and slug from the project directory name.
6. Create project configuration with default artifact discovery rules for all registered kit artifact kinds.
7. Install all available kits by copying kit files into their config directories.
8. Generate agent entry points for all selected agents.
9. Inject a managed navigation block into the project root `AGENTS.md` (creating the file if absent) so that AI agents are automatically routed to Cypilot. Every subsequent CLI invocation MUST verify this block exists and is correct.
10. Support non-interactive mode for CI/scripting. After completion, display a prompt suggestion.

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

#### Config Directory

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-config`

The system MUST maintain a structured project configuration. The system MUST:

1. Store all configuration in human-readable format. Config files MUST be edited exclusively by the tool — never by humans directly. Config changes MUST produce clean version-control diffs.
2. Provide per-kit file directories (path configurable per kit) containing all kit files — all user-editable. On update, changed files MUST be presented via interactive diff (see `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-resource-diff`).
3. Support automatic config migration between versions when the tool is updated.
4. Support artifact discovery rules for hierarchical monorepos where systems can be nested.

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

#### Deterministic Skill Engine

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-skill-engine`

The system MUST provide a deterministic command engine. All validation, scanning, and transformation logic MUST be deterministic (same input → same output). All commands MUST support both human-readable and machine-readable output for CI integration.

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-ai-agent`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-ci-pipeline`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

#### Generic Workflows

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-workflows`

The system MUST provide structured workflows for write operations (create, edit, fix, update, implement) and read operations (validate, review, check, inspect, audit). Workflows MUST be portable across projects without hardcoded paths. Workflows MUST support transparent execution logging so users can observe agent reasoning.

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-ai-agent`

#### Multi-Agent Integration

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-agents`

The system MUST provide a command that generates integration files for all supported AI coding assistants so each agent can access Cypilot workflows. Supported agents MUST include Windsurf, Cursor, Claude, Copilot, and OpenAI. The command MUST support regenerating integration files for a specific agent or for all agents at once. The command always fully regenerates integration files on each invocation.

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-ai-agent`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

#### Extensible Kit System

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-kits`

The system MUST support extensible kit packages installable from GitHub repositories. Each kit is a file package containing:

1. **Kit files** — per-artifact directories with rules, templates, checklists, and examples, plus kit-wide constraint definitions, version metadata, and optional directories for workflows, scripts, and codebase rules. All files are user-editable.
2. **Installation from GitHub** — the tool MUST support installing kits from GitHub repositories. The tool MUST ask the user for the kit config output directory. The tool MUST copy all kit files from the downloaded source and register the kit in project configuration with the GitHub source and version.
3. **GitHub-based versioning** — each kit MUST be versioned via GitHub tags/releases. The kit's source (`github:<owner>/<repo>`) and version (GitHub tag) MUST be stored in `core.toml` kit section.
4. **Update with file-level diff** — the tool MUST support two update modes: **force** (overwrites all kit files) and **interactive** (default, uses file-level diff with resolution modes — see `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-resource-diff`). Kit updates download the new version from GitHub.
5. **SKILL extensions** — a kit MAY extend the core agent entry point with kit-specific commands and workflows.
6. **System prompt extensions** — a kit MAY include agent configuration content that is automatically loaded when the kit's artifacts or workflows are used.
7. **Workflow registrations** — a kit MAY include workflow files that generate agent entry points.
8. **Kit config relocation** — the system MUST provide a command to move a kit's config directory to a new location, update project configuration, and preserve all user edits.
9. **Kit prompt during init** — during project initialization, the tool MUST offer to install the recommended SDLC kit with an accept/decline prompt. If accepted, the kit is downloaded and installed inline. If declined, the user can install it later. In non-interactive mode, the prompt is skipped.

**User extensibility**: users MUST be able to edit any kit file. User modifications MUST be preserved across interactive kit updates via file-level diff.

The system MUST provide CLI commands to: install kits from GitHub, update kits, move kit config, create new custom kits, and validate kit structure. The tool MUST NOT bundle any domain-specific kits.

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

#### Declarative Kit Installation Manifest

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-kit-manifest`

A kit MAY include a declarative installation manifest at its root. When present, the manifest governs the entire installation and update process. The system MUST:

1. **Declare kit resources** — the manifest MUST enumerate all resources the kit provides, each with a unique identifier, a default destination path, and a flag indicating whether the user can override the path.
2. **Prompt for modifiable paths** — for user-modifiable resources, the system MUST prompt the user for the destination path during installation, offering a default. Non-modifiable resources MUST be placed at the default path silently.
3. **Support kit root override** — the user MUST be able to override the entire kit root directory during installation when the manifest permits it.
4. **Persist resolved paths** — all resolved resource paths MUST be stored in project configuration and retrievable via CLI.
5. **Template variable resolution** — resource identifiers MUST be usable as template variables in kit files and resolvable by workflows during execution.
6. **Handle updates** — on kit update, the system MUST apply changes to registered resource paths, prompt the user for new unregistered resources, and warn about removed resources without auto-deleting user files.
7. **Backward compatibility** — when updating a kit that was installed without a manifest (legacy install), and the new version introduces a manifest, the system MUST auto-register all resource paths from existing files without requiring re-installation.
8. **Graceful fallback** — when no manifest is present, the system MUST fall back to the current installation behavior.

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

#### Generated Resource Editing & Interactive Diff

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-resource-diff`

All kit files in the kit's config directory MUST be user-editable. Users MAY freely modify any kit file at any time. On kit update, the system MUST compare the new version of each file against the user's installed copy. **IF** the content is identical → no action needed. **IF** the content differs → the system MUST present an interactive diff allowing the user to accept, reject, or manually merge each change. The system MUST support batch accept/reject for all remaining files. The system MUST NOT accept a file with unresolved conflicts.

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

#### Directory Layout Migration

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-layout-migration`

The system MUST automatically restructure the directory layout during updates when an old layout is detected. The migration MUST:

1. Move kit files from old locations to the current layout structure.
2. Remove obsolete directories.
3. Update project configuration with new paths.

The migration MUST NOT lose any user modifications to kit files. The migration MUST create a backup before proceeding. If migration fails, the backup MUST be restored and the user notified with actionable guidance.

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

#### ID and Traceability System

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-traceability`

The system MUST provide a unique identifier system for all design elements with search, validation, and cross-reference resolution. The system MUST:

1. Support code tags linking implementation to design for bidirectional traceability.
2. Provide configurable traceability validation levels per artifact.
3. Provide search and query commands: list IDs, list ID kinds, get content, find definitions, find usages.
4. Support ID versioning — when an ID is replaced, references MUST be updated across all artifacts and code.
5. Validate cross-artifact consistency: all cross-references resolve, and checked references imply checked definitions.

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-ai-agent`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-ci-pipeline`

#### Cypilot DSL (CDSL)

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-cdsl`

The system MUST define a plain English behavioral specification language (CDSL) for actor flows, algorithms, and state descriptions. CDSL MUST be readable by non-programmers for validation and review. CDSL MUST translate directly to code with traceability tags. CDSL MUST be actor-centric. CDSL MUST support implementation tracking so teams can monitor progress per specification.

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-ai-agent`

#### Version Detection and Updates

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-version`

The system MUST provide a project update command that updates the project tool (skill) to the latest available version. The update MUST:

1. Automatically migrate project configuration between versions, preserving all user settings.
2. Detect the directory layout version and trigger layout migration if needed (see `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-layout-migration`).
3. Regenerate agent integration files for compatibility.
4. Migrate bundled kit references to GitHub sources for projects upgrading from versions < 3.0.8.

The update command MUST NOT update kit files — kit updates are a separate operation. Version information MUST be accessible via a version query. The system MUST support checking for available updates without applying them.

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

#### CLI Configuration Interface

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-cli-config`

The system MUST provide rich CLI commands for project configuration without manual file editing. Core CLI commands MUST support: managing system definitions (add/remove/rename systems, assign kits), managing the ignore list (add/remove patterns with reasons), and registering/installing kits. Kit-specific config changes MUST be delegated to the kit's plugin CLI commands. All config changes MUST go through the tool to maintain config integrity and versioning. The CLI MUST provide dry-run mode for config changes and support reading current config values.

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

#### Template Quality Assurance

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-template-qa`

The system MUST provide a template quality assurance capability that validates example artifacts against their templates. The validation MUST ensure that the example artifact passes all template validation rules. This ensures that templates and examples remain synchronized and that templates are valid.

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

#### Table of Contents Management

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-toc`

The system MUST provide table of contents generation and validation for Markdown files. TOC generation MUST create or update table of contents blocks with configurable heading level ranges. TOC validation MUST verify that TOC exists, anchors point to real headings, all headings are covered, and the TOC is not stale. Both operations MUST support batch processing of multiple files.

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

#### Environment Diagnostics

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-doctor`

The system MUST provide an environment diagnostics command that checks environment health: runtime prerequisites, git availability, GitHub integration status, agent detection (which supported agents are present), config integrity validation, installed version status, and kit structural correctness. The command MUST output a clear pass/fail report with actionable remediation steps for each failed check.

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

#### Pre-Commit Hook Integration

- [ ] `p3` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-hooks`

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

#### Shell Completions

- [ ] `p3` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-completions`

The system MUST provide shell completion scripts for bash, zsh, and fish. Completions MUST cover all commands, subcommands, and common options. The system MUST support installing completions for the user's shell.

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

#### VS Code Plugin

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-vscode-plugin`

The system MUST provide a VS Code extension (compatible with VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf) for IDE-native Cypilot support. The plugin MUST provide:

1. **ID Syntax Highlighting** — `cpt-*` identifiers MUST be visually distinguished in Markdown files (definitions, references, and code tags `@cpt-*`) with configurable color scheme.
2. **Go to Definition / Find References** — clicking a `cpt-*` reference MUST navigate to its definition; clicking a definition MUST show all references across the workspace (equivalent to `where-defined` / `where-used`).
3. **Real-Time Validation** — artifact documents MUST be validated on save (or on keystroke with debounce) against their template structure; validation issues MUST appear inline in the editor with a summary in the problems panel.
4. **ID Autocompletion** — typing `cpt-` MUST trigger autocompletion with all known IDs from the project registry, grouped by kind (actor, fr, nfr, usecase, etc.).
5. **Hover Information** — hovering over a `cpt-*` ID MUST show a tooltip with: definition location, artifact kind, priority, checked/unchecked status, and first line of content.
6. **Cross-Artifact Link Lens** — annotations above ID definitions MUST show reference count and coverage status (e.g., "3 references · covered by DESIGN, DECOMPOSITION").
7. **Traceability Tree View** — a sidebar panel MUST display the traceability tree: PRD → DESIGN → DECOMPOSITION → FEATURE → CODE, with checked/unchecked status per ID and click-to-navigate.
8. **Validation Status Bar** — the status bar MUST show current artifact validation status (PASS/FAIL with error count) and click to run full validation.
9. **Quick Fix Actions** — common validation issues (missing priority marker, placeholder detected, duplicate ID) MUST offer quick fix suggestions inline.
10. **Config-Aware** — the plugin MUST read the Cypilot config from the project's install directory to resolve systems, kits, autodetect rules, and ignore lists. The plugin MUST NOT require separate configuration.

The plugin MUST delegate all validation logic to the installed Cypilot CLI to ensure consistency between CLI and IDE results. The plugin MUST support workspaces with multiple systems.

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`

### 5.2 SDLC Kit (EXTRACTED — External Package)

> **EXTRACTED**: The SDLC kit has been extracted to a separate GitHub repository (`cyberfabric/cyber-pilot-kit-sdlc`). See ADR-0013 for details. All SDLC-specific functional requirements are now owned by the kit's own repository. Cypilot core knows only that the SDLC kit exists and is offered for installation during project initialization.
>
> All `cpt-cypilot-fr-sdlc-*` requirement IDs (pipeline, plugin, validation, cross-artifact, code-gen, brownfield, lifecycle, guides, pr-review, pr-status, pr-config) have been moved to the kit repository.

---

## 9. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Project initialization completes interactive setup and creates a working install directory in ≤ 5 minutes
- [ ] Deterministic validation output is actionable (clear file/line/pointer for every issue)
- [ ] All supported agents receive correct integration files after agent generation
- [ ] Environment diagnostics reports environment health with pass/fail per check
- [ ] Config is never manually edited — all changes go through the CLI tool
- [ ] PR review workflow produces a structured report matching the template format

## 10. Dependencies

| Dependency | Description | Criticality |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| Runtime platform | Cross-platform runtime for CLI tool and command engine | p1 |
| Git | Project detection, version control | p1 |
| Global installer | Single-command global CLI installation | p2 |
| GitHub integration | API access for PR review/status workflows | p2 |

## 11. Assumptions

- AI coding assistants (Windsurf, Cursor, Claude, Copilot) can follow structured markdown workflows with embedded instructions.
- Developers have the required runtime platform available.
- Projects use Git for version control (project detection relies on `.git` directory).
- Teams are willing to maintain design artifacts as part of their development workflow.
- Global CLI installation prerequisites are available.
- GitHub is the primary VCS platform for PR review workflows (other platforms may be supported later).

### Open Questions

No open questions remain at this time — all architectural questions (config directory structure, kit structure, PR review placement in SDLC kit) were resolved during PRD development.

## 12. Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| AI agent variability | Inconsistent artifact quality across different agents | Deterministic validation catches structural issues; checklists enforce quality baseline |
| Adoption resistance | Teams bypass the workflow or skip validation | Incremental adoption via brownfield support; immediate value from validation and PR review |
| Kit rigidity | Templates don't fit all project types | Kit extension system allows custom overrides; custom kits can be created from scratch |
| Version fragmentation | Different team members have different skill versions | Version detection on every invocation; config migration ensures backward compatibility |
| Network dependency for updates | Network required for installation and updates | Tool is installed once and works offline; updates are optional and explicit |
