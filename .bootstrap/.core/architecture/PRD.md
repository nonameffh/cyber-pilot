## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

Cypilot is a deterministic agent tool that embeds into AI coding assistants and CI pipelines to provide structured workflows, artifact validation, and design-to-code traceability. Cypilot maximizes determinism: everything that can be validated, checked, or enforced without an LLM is handled deterministically; the LLM is reserved only for tasks that require reasoning, creativity, or natural language understanding.

The system is a single-layer generic engine:

- **Core** — deterministic command engine, generic workflows (generate/analyze), multi-agent integrations, global CLI, project configuration management, extensible kit system with GitHub-based kit installation, ID/traceability infrastructure, and Cypilot DSL (CDSL) for behavioral specifications

Domain-specific value is delivered by independently installable kits. The recommended SDLC kit (`cyberfabric/cyber-pilot-kit-sdlc`) provides an artifact-first development pipeline (PRD → DESIGN → ADR → DECOMPOSITION → FEATURE → CODE) with templates, checklists, examples, deterministic validation, cross-artifact consistency checks, and GitHub PR review/status workflows. Kits are external packages — Cypilot core contains no domain-specific content.

### 1.2 Background / Problem Statement

**Target Users**:
- Developers using AI coding assistants (Windsurf, Cursor, Claude, Copilot) for daily work
- Technical Leads setting up development methodology and project conventions
- Teams adopting structured design-to-code workflows with AI assistance
- DevOps engineers integrating Cypilot validation into CI/CD pipelines for artifact and code quality gates

**Key Problems Solved**:
- **AI Agent Non-Determinism**: AI agents produce inconsistent results without structured guardrails; deterministic validation catches structural and traceability issues that LLMs miss or hallucinate
- **Design-Code Disconnect**: Code diverges from design when there is no single source of truth and no automated traceability enforcement
- **Fragmented Tool Setup**: Each AI agent (Windsurf, Cursor, Claude, Copilot) requires different file formats for skills, workflows, and rules; maintaining these manually is error-prone
- **Inconsistent PR Reviews**: Code reviews vary in depth and focus without structured checklists and prompts; reviewers miss patterns that deterministic analysis catches
- **Manual Configuration Overhead**: Project-specific conventions, artifact locations, and validation rules require manual setup and synchronization across tools

### 1.3 Goals (Business Outcomes)

**Success Criteria**:
- A new user can install Cypilot globally and initialize a project in ≤ 5 minutes. (Baseline: not measured; Target: v2.0)
- Deterministic validation of any single artifact completes in ≤ 3 seconds on a typical developer laptop. (Baseline: ~1s current; Target: v2.0)
- 100% of `cpt-*` IDs defined in artifacts are resolvable via deterministic search without ambiguity. (Baseline: 100% current; Target: v2.0)
- Agent integration files for all supported agents are generated in ≤ 10 seconds. (Baseline: ~5s current; Target: v2.0)
- PR review workflow produces a structured review report within 2 minutes of invocation. (Baseline: not measured; Target: v2.0)

**Capabilities**:
- Install once globally, initialize per project with interactive setup
- Execute deterministic validation and traceability scanning without LLM
- Provide structured workflows for artifact creation, analysis, and code generation
- Generate and maintain agent-specific entry points for all supported AI assistants
- Review and assess GitHub PRs with configurable prompts and checklists
- Manage project configuration through a structured config directory edited only by the tool

## 5. Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Core

#### Global CLI Installer

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-installer`

The system MUST provide a global CLI tool installable with a single command. The tool MUST be available as both `cypilot` and the short alias `cpt`. The tool MUST:

1. Work both inside and outside projects.
2. Work offline after initial setup.
3. Perform non-blocking version checks — never delay command execution. Propose updates when a newer version is available.

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

#### Project Initialization

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-init`

The system MUST provide an interactive project initialization command that bootstraps Cypilot in a project. The command MUST:

1. Check for existing installation and refuse to overwrite — propose updating instead.
2. Ask for: installation directory, which agents to support (default: all), and per-kit config output directory.
3. Enable all available kits by default.
4. Set up the project directory structure.
5. Define a **root system** — deriving the project name and slug from the project directory name.
6. Create project configuration with default artifact discovery rules for all registered kit artifact kinds.
7. Install all available kits by copying kit files into their config directories.
8. Generate agent entry points for all selected agents.
9. Inject a managed navigation block into the project root `AGENTS.md` (creating the file if absent) so that AI agents are automatically routed to Cypilot. Every subsequent CLI invocation MUST verify this block exists and is correct.
10. Support non-interactive mode for CI/scripting. After completion, display a prompt suggestion.

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

#### Config Directory

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-config`

The system MUST maintain a structured project configuration. The system MUST:

1. Store all configuration in human-readable format. Config files MUST be edited exclusively by the tool — never by humans directly. Config changes MUST produce clean version-control diffs.
2. Provide per-kit file directories (path configurable per kit) containing all kit files — all user-editable. On update, changed files MUST be presented via interactive diff (see `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-resource-diff`).
3. Support automatic config migration between versions when the tool is updated.
4. Support artifact discovery rules for hierarchical monorepos where systems can be nested.

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

#### Deterministic Skill Engine

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-skill-engine`

The system MUST provide a deterministic command engine. All validation, scanning, and transformation logic MUST be deterministic (same input → same output). All commands MUST support both human-readable and machine-readable output for CI integration.

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-ai-agent`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-ci-pipeline`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

#### Generic Workflows

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-workflows`

The system MUST provide structured workflows for write operations (create, edit, fix, update, implement) and read operations (validate, review, check, inspect, audit). Workflows MUST be portable across projects without hardcoded paths. Workflows MUST support transparent execution logging so users can observe agent reasoning.

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-ai-agent`

#### Execution Plans

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-execution-plans`

The system MUST provide a plan workflow that decomposes large agent tasks into self-contained phase files. Each phase file MUST be a compiled prompt containing all rules, constraints, conventions, and context inlined — no external file references requiring Cypilot knowledge. Phase files MUST be executable by any AI agent without Cypilot context. The system MUST:

1. Support three decomposition strategies: by template sections (for artifact generation), by checklist categories (for analysis/validation), and by CDSL blocks (for code implementation).
2. Enforce a line budget: ≤500 lines target, ≤1000 lines maximum per phase file. If a phase exceeds the maximum, it MUST be split into sub-phases.
3. Store plans in a git-ignored directory (`{cypilot_path}/.plans/`) with a TOML manifest tracking phase status (pending/in_progress/done/failed).
4. Resolve all template variables before writing phase files — zero unresolved `{variable}` references in output.
5. Include binary acceptance criteria in each phase file so agents can self-verify completion.

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-ai-agent`

#### Multi-Agent Integration

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-agents`

The system MUST provide a command that generates integration files for all supported AI coding assistants so each agent can access Cypilot workflows. Supported agents MUST include Windsurf, Cursor, Claude, Copilot, and OpenAI. The command MUST support regenerating integration files for a specific agent or for all agents at once. The command always fully regenerates integration files on each invocation.

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-ai-agent`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

#### Extensible Kit System

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-kits`

The system MUST support extensible kit packages installable from GitHub repositories. Each kit is a file package containing:

1. **Kit files** — per-artifact directories with rules, templates, checklists, and examples, plus kit-wide constraint definitions, version metadata, and optional directories for workflows, scripts, and codebase rules. All files are user-editable.
2. **Installation from GitHub** — the tool MUST support installing kits from GitHub repositories. The tool MUST ask the user for the kit config output directory. The tool MUST copy all kit files from the downloaded source and register the kit in project configuration with the GitHub source and version.
3. **GitHub-based versioning** — each kit MUST be versioned via GitHub tags/releases. The kit's source (`github:<owner>/<repo>`) and version (GitHub tag) MUST be stored in `core.toml` kit section.
4. **Update with file-level diff** — the tool MUST support two update modes: **force** (overwrites all kit files) and **interactive** (default, uses file-level diff with resolution modes — see `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-resource-diff`). Kit updates download the new version from GitHub.
5. **SKILL extensions** — a kit MAY extend the core agent entry point with kit-specific commands and workflows.
6. **System prompt extensions** — a kit MAY include agent configuration content that is automatically loaded when the kit's artifacts or workflows are used.
7. **Workflow registrations** — a kit MAY include workflow files that generate agent entry points.
8. **Kit config relocation** — the system MUST provide a command to move a kit's config directory to a new location, update project configuration, and preserve all user edits.
9. **Kit prompt during init** — during project initialization, the tool MUST offer to install the recommended SDLC kit with an accept/decline prompt. If accepted, the kit is downloaded and installed inline. If declined, the user can install it later. In non-interactive mode, the prompt is skipped.

**User extensibility**: users MUST be able to edit any kit file. User modifications MUST be preserved across interactive kit updates via file-level diff.

The system MUST provide CLI commands to: install kits from GitHub, update kits, move kit config, create new custom kits, and validate kit structure. The tool MUST NOT bundle any domain-specific kits.

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

#### Declarative Kit Installation Manifest

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-kit-manifest`

A kit MAY include a declarative installation manifest at its root. When present, the manifest governs the entire installation and update process. The system MUST:

1. **Declare kit resources** — the manifest MUST enumerate all resources the kit provides, each with a unique identifier, a default destination path, and a flag indicating whether the user can override the path.
2. **Prompt for modifiable paths** — for user-modifiable resources, the system MUST prompt the user for the destination path during installation, offering a default. Non-modifiable resources MUST be placed at the default path silently.
3. **Support kit root override** — the user MUST be able to override the entire kit root directory during installation when the manifest permits it.
4. **Persist resolved paths** — all resolved resource paths MUST be stored in project configuration and retrievable via CLI.
5. **Template variable resolution** — resource identifiers MUST be usable as template variables in kit files and resolvable by workflows during execution.
6. **Handle updates** — on kit update, the system MUST apply changes to registered resource paths, prompt the user for new unregistered resources, and warn about removed resources without auto-deleting user files.
7. **Backward compatibility** — when updating a kit that was installed without a manifest (legacy install), and the new version introduces a manifest, the system MUST auto-register all resource paths from existing files without requiring re-installation.
8. **Graceful fallback** — when no manifest is present, the system MUST fall back to the current installation behavior.

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

#### Generated Resource Editing & Interactive Diff

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-resource-diff`

All kit files in the kit's config directory MUST be user-editable. Users MAY freely modify any kit file at any time. On kit update, the system MUST compare the new version of each file against the user's installed copy. **IF** the content is identical → no action needed. **IF** the content differs → the system MUST present an interactive diff allowing the user to accept, reject, or manually merge each change. The system MUST support batch accept/reject for all remaining files. The system MUST NOT accept a file with unresolved conflicts.

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

#### Directory Layout Migration

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-layout-migration`

The system MUST automatically restructure the directory layout during updates when an old layout is detected. The migration MUST:

1. Move kit files from old locations to the current layout structure.
2. Remove obsolete directories.
3. Update project configuration with new paths.

The migration MUST NOT lose any user modifications to kit files. The migration MUST create a backup before proceeding. If migration fails, the backup MUST be restored and the user notified with actionable guidance.

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

#### ID and Traceability System

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-traceability`

The system MUST provide a unique identifier system for all design elements with search, validation, and cross-reference resolution. The system MUST:

1. Support code tags linking implementation to design for bidirectional traceability.
2. Provide configurable traceability validation levels per artifact.
3. Provide search and query commands: list IDs, list ID kinds, get content, find definitions, find usages.
4. Support ID versioning — when an ID is replaced, references MUST be updated across all artifacts and code.
5. Validate cross-artifact consistency: all cross-references resolve, and checked references imply checked definitions.

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-ai-agent`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-ci-pipeline`

#### Multi-Repo Workspace Federation

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-workspace`

The system MUST support multi-repo workspace federation — discovering repositories in nested sub-directories, configuring sources, and enabling cross-repo artifact traceability without merging adapters. The system MUST:

1. **Config modes** — support two workspace configuration modes: standalone `.cypilot-workspace.toml` file and inline `[workspace]` section in `config/core.toml`.
2. **Config discovery** — discover workspace config by first checking the project's `core.toml` for a `workspace` key (string path or inline dict), then falling back to well-known standalone file `.cypilot-workspace.toml` at the project root — no implicit parent directory traversal.
3. **Source mapping** — each named source MUST map to a local filesystem path with optional adapter location and role (`artifacts`, `codebase`, `kits`, `full`).
4. **Path resolution** — source path resolution MUST be relative to the workspace file's parent directory (standalone) or project root (inline).
5. **CLI commands** — provide `workspace-init` (scan nested sub-directories for repos with `.git` or `AGENTS.md` marker, infer roles, generate config; scanning depth MUST be limited by a `--max-depth` parameter defaulting to 3 to prevent unbounded filesystem traversal), `workspace-add` with `--inline` flag (add sources to standalone or inline config), `workspace-info` (display workspace status with per-source reachability).
6. **Cross-repo traceability** — cross-repo traceability MUST be controllable via `cross_repo` and `resolve_remote_ids` settings.
7. **Duplicate ID detection** — detect and reject duplicate artifact ID definitions across workspace sources during cross-repo validation — if the same ID is defined in two different artifact files, the validator MUST report an error on each local definition listing all conflicting files.
8. **Validation flags** — provide `--local-only` flag for `validate` to skip cross-repo resolution (including duplicate ID detection), and `--source` filter for `list-ids`.
9. **Graceful degradation** — degrade gracefully when sources are unreachable — emit warnings to stderr and continue with available sources.
10. **Backward compatibility** — projects without workspace config MUST operate in single-repo mode with zero behavioral changes.

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-workspace-git-sources`

The system MUST support Git URL sources in standalone workspace configuration (`.cypilot-workspace.toml`). The system MUST:

1. **Source specification** — each Git URL source MUST specify: a remote Git repository URL, an optional branch or ref, and namespace resolution rules that map the URL to a local working directory path (e.g., `gitlab.com/org/project.git` → `org/project`).
2. **URL scheme validation** — Git URL sources MUST accept only HTTPS (`https://`) and SSH (`git@host:path`, `ssh://`) URL schemes; all other schemes (including `file://`, `ftp://`, plain `http://`) MUST be rejected with an error.
3. **Credential redaction** — URL credential redaction MUST be applied before displaying URLs in output or error messages.
4. **Auth delegation** — authentication for private repositories is delegated to the user's git configuration (SSH keys, credential helpers); the system MUST NOT store or prompt for credentials (see `cpt-cypilot-nfr-security-integrity`).
5. **Working directory** — the workspace MUST support a configurable working directory (defaulting to `.workspace-sources`) under which cloned repos are resolved via namespace rules.
6. **Inline exclusion** — Git URL sources MUST NOT be supported in inline workspace configuration (`config/core.toml`) — inline mode is designed for simple local multi-repo setups where all sources are co-located on the filesystem; Git URL sources introduce clone management, namespace resolution, and network operations that are better isolated in a dedicated standalone workspace file.
7. **Clone on first resolution** — the system MUST clone missing sources on first resolution and cache them locally.
8. **Explicit sync model** — updating existing Git URL sources MUST be performed explicitly via `workspace-sync`. Ordinary source resolution MUST NOT perform network operations for already-resolved repos.
9. **Branch defaulting** — branch configuration MUST be per-source (via `branch` field), defaulting to the remote repository's default branch when not specified.

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-workspace-cross-repo-editing`

The system MUST support cross-repo editing from a primary workspace repository. When a user works from a primary repo (e.g., a docs repo) and edits files in a remote source repo (e.g., backend or frontend), the system MUST apply the rules, templates, and Cypilot tooling from the remote source's own adapter — not from the primary repo's adapter. This ensures each repo's conventions are respected regardless of which repo the user is working from. The system MUST resolve the correct adapter context per-source for validation, generation, and traceability operations targeting that source. When a remote source has no adapter or its adapter cannot be loaded, the system MUST fall back to the primary repo's adapter for that source and emit a warning.

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

#### Cypilot DSL (CDSL)

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-cdsl`

The system MUST define a plain English behavioral specification language (CDSL) for actor flows, algorithms, and state descriptions. CDSL MUST be readable by non-programmers for validation and review. CDSL MUST translate directly to code with traceability tags. CDSL MUST be actor-centric. CDSL MUST support implementation tracking so teams can monitor progress per specification.

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-ai-agent`

#### Version Detection and Updates

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-version`

The system MUST provide a project update command that updates the project tool (skill) to the latest available version. The update MUST:

1. Automatically migrate project configuration between versions, preserving all user settings.
2. Detect the directory layout version and trigger layout migration if needed (see `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-layout-migration`).
3. Regenerate agent integration files for compatibility.
4. Migrate bundled kit references to GitHub sources for projects upgrading from versions < 3.0.8.

The update command MUST NOT update kit files — kit updates are a separate operation. Version information MUST be accessible via a version query. The system MUST support checking for available updates without applying them.

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

#### CLI Configuration Interface

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-cli-config`

The system MUST provide rich CLI commands for project configuration without manual file editing. Core CLI commands MUST support: managing system definitions (add/remove/rename systems, assign kits), managing the ignore list (add/remove patterns with reasons), and registering/installing kits. Kit-specific config changes MUST be delegated to the kit's plugin CLI commands. All config changes MUST go through the tool to maintain config integrity and versioning. The CLI MUST provide dry-run mode for config changes and support reading current config values.

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

#### Template Quality Assurance

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-template-qa`

The system MUST provide a template quality assurance capability that validates example artifacts against their templates. The validation MUST ensure that the example artifact passes all template validation rules. This ensures that templates and examples remain synchronized and that templates are valid.

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

#### Table of Contents Management

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-toc`

The system MUST provide table of contents generation and validation for Markdown files. TOC generation MUST create or update table of contents blocks with configurable heading level ranges. TOC validation MUST verify that TOC exists, anchors point to real headings, all headings are covered, and the TOC is not stale. Both operations MUST support batch processing of multiple files.

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

#### Environment Diagnostics

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-doctor`

The system MUST provide an environment diagnostics command that checks environment health: runtime prerequisites, git availability, GitHub integration status, agent detection (which supported agents are present), config integrity validation, installed version status, and kit structural correctness. The command MUST output a clear pass/fail report with actionable remediation steps for each failed check.

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

#### Pre-Commit Hook Integration

- [ ] `p3` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-hooks`

The system MUST provide a pre-commit hook that runs lightweight validation on changed artifacts before commit. The hook MUST be fast (≤ 5 seconds for typical changes). The system MUST support installing and uninstalling the hook.

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

#### Shell Completions

- [ ] `p3` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-completions`

The system MUST provide shell completion scripts for bash, zsh, and fish. Completions MUST cover all commands, subcommands, and common options. The system MUST support installing completions for the user's shell.

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

#### VS Code Plugin

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-vscode-plugin`

The system MUST provide a VS Code extension (compatible with VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf) for IDE-native Cypilot support. The plugin MUST provide:

1. **ID Syntax Highlighting** — `cpt-*` identifiers MUST be visually distinguished in Markdown files (definitions, references, and code tags `@cpt-*`) with configurable color scheme.
2. **Go to Definition / Find References** — clicking a `cpt-*` reference MUST navigate to its definition; clicking a definition MUST show all references across the workspace (equivalent to `where-defined` / `where-used`).
3. **Real-Time Validation** — artifact documents MUST be validated on save (or on keystroke with debounce) against their template structure; validation issues MUST appear inline in the editor with a summary in the problems panel.
4. **ID Autocompletion** — typing `cpt-` MUST trigger autocompletion with all known IDs from the project registry, grouped by kind (actor, fr, nfr, usecase, etc.).
5. **Hover Information** — hovering over a `cpt-*` ID MUST show a tooltip with: definition location, artifact kind, priority, checked/unchecked status, and first line of content.
6. **Cross-Artifact Link Lens** — annotations above ID definitions MUST show reference count and coverage status (e.g., "3 references · covered by DESIGN, DECOMPOSITION").
7. **Traceability Tree View** — a sidebar panel MUST display the traceability tree: PRD → DESIGN → DECOMPOSITION → FEATURE → CODE, with checked/unchecked status per ID and click-to-navigate.
8. **Validation Status Bar** — the status bar MUST show current artifact validation status (PASS/FAIL with error count) and click to run full validation.
9. **Quick Fix Actions** — common validation issues (missing priority marker, placeholder detected, duplicate ID) MUST offer quick fix suggestions inline.
10. **Config-Aware** — the plugin MUST read the Cypilot config from the project's install directory to resolve systems, kits, autodetect rules, and ignore lists. The plugin MUST NOT require separate configuration.

The plugin MUST delegate all validation logic to the installed Cypilot CLI to ensure consistency between CLI and IDE results. The plugin MUST support workspaces with multiple systems.

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`

### 5.2 SDLC Kit (EXTRACTED — External Package)

> **EXTRACTED**: The SDLC kit has been extracted to a separate GitHub repository (`cyberfabric/cyber-pilot-kit-sdlc`). See ADR-0013 for details. All SDLC-specific functional requirements are now owned by the kit's own repository. Cypilot core knows only that the SDLC kit exists and is offered for installation during project initialization.
>
> All `cpt-cypilot-fr-sdlc-*` requirement IDs (pipeline, plugin, validation, cross-artifact, code-gen, brownfield, lifecycle, guides, pr-review, pr-status, pr-config) have been moved to the kit repository.

- **Bundled kit detected**: Tool automatically migrates kit reference to GitHub source (versions < 3.0.8).

**Postconditions**: Project tool updated to latest version; layout migrated if needed; bundled kit references migrated to GitHub sources; agent integration refreshed. Kit file updates are a separate operation

---

### UC-012 Migrate Existing Project

**ID**: `cpt-cypilot-usecase-migrate`

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-ai-agent`

`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-ai-agent`

**Preconditions**: Cypilot mode enabled; kit with target artifact kind is registered; task is large enough to benefit from decomposition

**Flow**:

1. User requests plan-based execution (e.g., "plan generate PRD", "plan analyze DESIGN")
2. AI Agent loads task context: artifact kind, kit dependencies (template, rules, checklist, constraints) (uses capability `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-workflows`)
3. AI Agent decomposes task into phases using the appropriate strategy (by template sections, checklist categories, or CDSL blocks) (uses capability `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-execution-plans`)
4. AI Agent compiles each phase into a self-contained phase file with inlined rules, pre-resolved paths, and binary acceptance criteria
5. AI Agent enforces line budget (≤500 target, ≤1000 max) — splits phases that exceed budget
6. AI Agent writes plan manifest (`plan.toml`) and phase files to `{cypilot_path}/.plans/{task-slug}/`
7. AI Agent reports plan summary: total phases, estimated size, execution order
8. User triggers phase execution one at a time; agent reads phase file and follows self-contained instructions
9. After each phase, agent self-checks against acceptance criteria and updates manifest status

**Alternative Flows**:
- **Task fits in single context**: Agent skips plan generation and executes directly via generate/analyze workflow.
- **Phase exceeds budget after compilation**: Agent splits the phase into sub-phases and regenerates.
- **Phase fails acceptance criteria**: Agent marks phase as failed in manifest; user can retry or adjust.

**Postconditions**: Plan directory created with manifest and phase files; phases executable independently; `.plans/` directory git-ignored

---

### UC-014 Initialize Multi-Repo Workspace

**ID**: `cpt-cypilot-usecase-workspace-init`

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

**Preconditions**: Cypilot initialized in project; one or more sibling repositories exist in nested sub-directories

**Flow**:

1. User runs `workspace-init [--root DIR] [--output PATH] [--inline] [--force] [--max-depth N] [--dry-run]` from project root
2. Tool scans nested sub-directories (up to `--max-depth` levels, default 3) for repos with `.git` or `AGENTS.md` with `@cpt:root-agents` marker (uses capability `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-workspace`)
3. Tool infers source roles (`artifacts`, `codebase`, `kits`, `full`) based on adapter contents
4. Tool checks for existing workspace config conflicts (cross-type or same-type without `--force`)
5. Tool writes workspace config with discovered sources and default traceability settings: standalone `.cypilot-workspace.toml` by default, or inline `[workspace]` in `config/core.toml` when `--inline` is specified

**Alternative Flows**:
- **No nested repos found**: Tool creates an empty workspace config; user can add sources incrementally via `workspace-add`.
- **Workspace config already exists**: Tool rejects unless `--force` is specified.
- **`--dry-run` specified**: Tool displays discovered sources without writing files.

**Postconditions**: Workspace config created; sources registered with paths, roles, and adapter locations

---

### UC-015 Add Workspace Source

**ID**: `cpt-cypilot-usecase-workspace-add`

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

**Preconditions**: Workspace config exists (standalone or inline)

**Flow**:

1. User runs `workspace-add` with source name and path or Git URL (uses capability `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-workspace`)
2. Tool auto-detects workspace type (standalone vs inline) when `--inline` not specified
3. Tool validates source: path must be a directory (local) or valid Git URL (standalone only, per `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-workspace-git-sources`)
4. Tool adds source entry with name, path/URL, optional branch, role, and adapter path
5. If source name already exists, tool returns error: "Source '{name}' already exists. Use --force to replace."
6. If `--force` specified and source name already exists, tool replaces the existing entry

**Alternative Flows**:
- **Name collision without `--force`**: Tool returns error directing user to use `--force` flag.
- **Git URL with `--inline`**: Tool rejects — Git URL sources are not supported in inline mode.
- **Standalone workspace exists but `--inline` specified**: Tool rejects to prevent parallel configs.
- **Source path unreachable**: Tool adds the entry; reachability is checked at runtime by `workspace-info` and `validate`.

**Postconditions**: Source registered in workspace config; available for cross-repo operations

---

### UC-016 Check Workspace Status

**ID**: `cpt-cypilot-usecase-workspace-info`

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

**Preconditions**: Workspace config exists

**Flow**:

1. User runs `workspace-info` (uses capability `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-workspace`)
2. Tool loads workspace config and resolves each source path
3. For each source: checks reachability, probes for adapter directory, loads artifact metadata
4. Tool reports: workspace version, config location, per-source status (reachable, adapter found, artifact/system counts), traceability settings (`cross_repo`, `resolve_remote_ids`), and any config warnings
5. User can then run `validate` (with `--local-only` or `--source` flags) or `list-ids --source` to inspect specific sources

**Alternative Flows**:
- **Source unreachable**: Tool reports warning per source; remaining sources are still displayed.
- **No workspace config found**: Tool returns error with guidance to run `workspace-init`.

**Postconditions**: User has visibility into workspace health and per-source status

---

### UC-017 Sync Git URL Workspace Sources

**ID**: `cpt-cypilot-usecase-workspace-sync`

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

**Preconditions**: Workspace config exists with at least one Git URL source (per `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-workspace-git-sources`)

**Flow**:

1. User runs `workspace-sync` (optionally with `--source <name>` to target a single source, `--dry-run` to preview, or `--force` to skip safety checks) (uses capability `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-workspace-git-sources`)
2. Tool loads workspace config and collects Git URL sources (filtered by `--source` if provided)
3. For each Git URL source: checks the local worktree for uncommitted changes; aborts that source with an error if dirty (unless `--force` is set)
4. For each clean (or forced) source: fetches remote changes and updates the local worktree to the configured branch (or the remote default branch if not specified)
5. Tool reports per-source sync status (synced / failed / dirty) with error details for failures

**Alternative Flows**:
- **Dirty worktree detected**: Tool reports per-source error listing dirty sources; sync is skipped for those sources. User must commit/stash changes or re-run with `--force`.
- **Force mode**: Tool skips the dirty worktree check and proceeds with destructive git operations.
- **Dry-run mode**: Tool lists sources that would be synced (name, URL, branch) without performing network operations.
- **Named source not found**: Tool returns error with list of available source names.
- **Named source has no URL**: Tool returns error — only Git URL sources can be synced.
- **No Git URL sources**: Tool returns OK with zero synced, zero failed.
- **Partial failure**: If at least one source syncs successfully, overall status is OK with per-source error details for failures.
- **All sources fail**: Tool returns FAIL status with per-source error details.

**Postconditions**: Git URL workspace sources are up to date with their remote branches

---

### UC-018 Validate or Generate in Remote Workspace Source

**ID**: `cpt-cypilot-usecase-workspace-cross-repo-editing`

**Actors**:
`cpt-cypilot-actor-user`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-ai-agent`, `cpt-cypilot-actor-cypilot-cli`

**Preconditions**: Workspace config exists with at least one reachable source that has a Cypilot adapter

**Flow**:

1. User targets a file or artifact located in a remote workspace source (e.g., `validate --artifact ../backend/architecture/DESIGN.md` or `validate --source backend`) (uses capability `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-workspace-cross-repo-editing`)
2. Tool resolves which workspace source owns the target file by matching paths against resolved source paths (longest-prefix match)
3. Tool loads the remote source's own adapter context (rules, templates, constraints, kits) instead of the primary repo's adapter
4. Tool performs the requested operation (validation, generation, traceability) using the remote adapter context
5. Tool reports results normally

**Alternative Flows**:
- **Remote source has no adapter**: Tool falls back to the primary repo's adapter for that source and emits a warning.
- **Remote source is unreachable**: Tool emits warning and skips (graceful degradation per `cpt-cypilot-fr-core-workspace`).
- **File does not belong to any workspace source**: Tool uses the primary repo's adapter (file is local).

**Postconditions**: Operation completed using the correct per-source adapter context

- [ ] PR review workflow produces a structured report matching the template format
- [ ] `workspace-init` discovers nested repositories and generates valid workspace configuration
- [ ] Git URL sources are cloned and cached on first resolution without blocking subsequent operations
- [ ] Cross-repo validation resolves IDs from remote sources when `cross_repo` and `resolve_remote_ids` are enabled
- [ ] Cross-repo editing applies the correct source adapter's rules and templates
- [ ] Workspace operates with graceful degradation when sources are unreachable (warnings only, no fatal errors)
- [ ] Projects without workspace config continue to operate in single-repo mode with zero behavioral changes

## 10. Dependencies

| Dependency | Description | Criticality |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| Runtime platform | Cross-platform runtime for CLI tool and command engine | p1 |
| Git | Project detection, version control | p1 |
| Global installer | Single-command global CLI installation | p2 |
| GitHub integration | API access for PR review/status workflows | p2 |

## 11. Assumptions

- AI coding assistants (Windsurf, Cursor, Claude, Copilot) can follow structured markdown workflows with embedded instructions.
- Developers have the required runtime platform available.
- Projects use Git for version control (project detection relies on `.git` directory).
- Teams are willing to maintain design artifacts as part of their development workflow.
- Global CLI installation prerequisites are available.
- GitHub is the primary VCS platform for PR review workflows (other platforms may be supported later).

### Open Questions

No open questions remain at this time — all architectural questions (config directory structure, kit structure, PR review placement in SDLC kit) were resolved during PRD development.

## 12. Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| AI agent variability | Inconsistent artifact quality across different agents | Deterministic validation catches structural issues; checklists enforce quality baseline |
| Adoption resistance | Teams bypass the workflow or skip validation | Incremental adoption via brownfield support; immediate value from validation and PR review |
| Kit rigidity | Templates don't fit all project types | Kit extension system allows custom overrides; custom kits can be created from scratch |
| Version fragmentation | Different team members have different skill versions | Version detection on every invocation; config migration ensures backward compatibility |
| Network dependency for updates | Network required for installation and updates | Tool is installed once and works offline; updates are optional and explicit |
